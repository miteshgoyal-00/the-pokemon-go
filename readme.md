# The Pokemon Go Project

This project draws inspiration from Niantic's renowned game, Pokémon Go. It is crafted to provide an engaging experience while enhancing your logic-building skills.

## Overview

- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Naming Conventions

- **Variable and Function Names**: Utilize underscores `_` for multi-word identifiers (e.g., `variable_name`).
- **File Names**: Employ hyphens `-` for multi-word filenames (e.g., `file-name.js`).
- **MongoDB Model Properties**: Adopt camelCase notation (e.g., `propertyName`).

## Purpose

This project serves both educational and entertainment purposes. It offers an opportunity to delve into backend logic and database interactions akin to those found in Pokémon Go.

## About Pokémon Go

Pokémon Go is an augmented reality (AR) mobile game developed by Niantic. It allows players to capture, train, and battle virtual creatures called Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player's real-world location. The game encourages physical activity and exploration, making it a unique blend of gaming and real-world interaction.

<!-- ## Features

- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Learn how to manage real-time data using Express.js and MongoDB.
- **User Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication mechanisms.
- **Pokémon Data Management**: Handle data related to various Pokémon, including their attributes and statistics.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Simulate gameplay mechanics such as capturing and training Pokémon.
